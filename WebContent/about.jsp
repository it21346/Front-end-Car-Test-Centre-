			How to Maintain your Vehicle
			</h1>
			    <p><b>Read Your Owner's Manual</b></p>
			    <p>Pay attention to your owners manual. Regardless of the vehicle you drive, your regular maintenance schedule is inside it, and youll never fall for old car myths like, You should change your oil every 3,000 miles, (unless of course, your manual says you should, and odds are it doesnt). You will, however, discover how often your manufacturer really does suggest you change your oil (it can vary widely by vehicle), your filters, any drive or timing belts in your vehicle, and more. Youll even find out whether youre putting the right gas in your vehicle or whether youre using the right kind of oil in the first place.</p>
			    <p><b>Preventive Maintenance Every Vehicle Needs</b></p>
			    <p>Do your own inspection. Its basic, but give your car a once-over periodically so you catch anything that looks out of the ordinary. Make sure all your lights are working. Check the air pressure in your tires every month or so (and buy a cheap tire air pressure gauge and keep it in the glove compartment). </p>
			    <p>Learn to check your fluids. Even if you dont ever learn how to change your antifreeze, power steering, coolant, or even your wiper fluid (although seriously, dont let someone charge you to change wiper fluid), you should learn how to check those fluid levels. </p>
			    <p>Check your oil and get it changed regularly. Whether your car has a dipstick to check the oils color and oil level or the dipstick has been replaced with an electronic gauge, you should know how to check it. Knowing the difference between clean oil and muddy, murky oil will save you a ton on unnecessary changes and gives you a way to tell if somethings wrong with your engine (e.g. the oil looks terrible but you just had it changed).</p>
			    <p><b>Use Technology to Track Your Maintenance</b></p>
			    <p>Car Maintenance Reminder (Android) is a free app that will keep track of your fuel efficiency, cost, and mileage, but also gives you a place to track all of the maintenance and repairs you have done to your vehicle. You can add notes, costs, and of course, get notifications and reminders when you should get some work done. The free version tracks one vehicle. If you have more than one, the $3 pro version is for you.</p>
			    <p><b>Dont Ignore Issues, Consult a Professional When You Need To</b></p>
			    <p>Always consult a pro when you can't do it yourself.</p>
